👨‍💻 Backend Developer | Java & Spring Boot Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I'm a passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in Java and hands-on experience building RESTful APIs using Spring Boot. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions — especially when it comes to debugging, optimizing systems, and building scalable applications.

🔧 Tech Stack: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, MySQL, Git, Docker (learning), Linux  
📈 Currently leveling up in: Spring Security, Microservices, CI/CD, Data Structures & Algorithms  
🎯 Goal: To become a strong full-stack engineer and contribute to impactful, real-world projects — especially in fintech and devtools.

💡 I believe in learning by building, and I'm currently working on a 100-projects challenge to master backend concepts step by step.
